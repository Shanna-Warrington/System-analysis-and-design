# System-analysis-and-design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company looking to help students pass their driving tests. They have various packages for the customer to sign up for that includes driving lessons in each one as well as some with in person lessons and various other help for driving tests. The system was a web based system that allowed the customer to sign up for packages and work through the lesson plans online.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I did well on the system design document. I enjoyed creating the diagrams for the various use cases and activities. It allowed me to work through the system and see how it would work live.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I woud wish to edit the business requirements document. I feel that while I have a good start to it, I could have fleshed it out more and made it more comprehensive.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to take into consideration how the user would interact with the system and how to make it user friendly. How would I use the system? How would a young student feel using the system? You always need to keep in mind your audience when designing anything.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would definitely use the documents that I have learned. Also the various diagrams that help you to visualize the system. Being able to mentally walk through the system before you design or program it will save a lot of time and effort in the end.
